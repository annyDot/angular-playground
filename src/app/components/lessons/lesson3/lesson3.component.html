<h2>Sharing Data Between Parent and Child Components</h2>
<p>First of all, the idea of Input and Output is to exchange data between components. 
  They are a mechanism to send/receive data from one component to another.
  @Input() and @Output() give a child component a way to communicate with its parent component.
  @Input() lets a parent component update data in the child component. Conversely, 
  @Output() lets the child send data to a parent component.
</p>

<!--The event binding, (newNameEvent)='addToNames($event)', connects the event in the child, newNameEvent, to the method in the parent, addToNames().-->
<app-hello [name]='currentName' (newNameEvent)="addToNames($event)"></app-hello>

Parent's name list:

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <th>Index</th>
    <th>Name</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr *ngFor="let name of names;let i = index;">
      <td>{{ i+ 1 }}</td>
      <td>{{ name }}</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
