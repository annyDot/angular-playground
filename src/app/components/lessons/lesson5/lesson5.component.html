<h2>Lesson 5: RxJs and Observables</h2>
<p>
  The essential concepts in RxJS (Reactive Extensions Library for JavaScript)
  which solve async event management are:<br /><br />
</p>

<h4>Observables</h4>
<li>
  Observables are simply functions that are able to give multiple values over
  time, either synchronously or asynchronously. They are different from promises
  because: they are lazy (we have to subscribe to them to get data) while
  promises execute immediately; observables handle multiple values unlike
  promises which can only provide a single value; observables are cancelable
  (you can unsubscribe from them) while promises don't have such a feature and
  observables provide many useful operators that allow us to transform the way
  data is handled, transformed or displayed.
</li>
<br /><br />

<h4>Subject</h4>
<li>
  A Subject is a special type of Observable that can act as both observable & an
  observer. It is equivalent to an EventEmitter, and the only way of
  multicasting a value or event to multiple Observers. What does that mean? It
  means that a subject can emit data, on top of having the capability to be
  subscribed to. Subjects implement both subscribe() method and next(), error()
  & complete() methods. Subject can be used in a service to fetch some data, and
  send the result to all components that subscribed to that Subject. Do not
  expose the Subject object directly to components. Instead, return an
  Observable version of it which will make the code much safer and prevent poor
  coding practices.
</li>
<br /><br />

<h4>Observers</h4>
<li>
  The Observable on its own is useless unless someone consumes the value emitted
  by the observable. We call them observers or subscribers. The observers
  communicate with the Observable using callbacks. The observer must subscribe
  with the observable to receive the value from the observable. While
  subscribing it optionally passes the three callbacks. <b>next()</b>,
  <b>error()</b> and <b>complete()</b>. All 3 callbacks are optional!
  <br /><br />The observable starts emitting the value as soon as the observer
  or consumer subscribes to it. The observable invokes the next() callback
  whenever the value arrives in the stream. It passes the value as the argument
  to the next callback. If the error occurs, then the error() callback is
  invoked. It invokes the complete() callback when the stream completes.
</li>
<br /><br />

<h4>Subscriptions</h4>
<li>
  Subscriptions are objects that are returned when you subscribe to an
  Observable. They contain many methods such as the unsubscribe() method that
  you can call to unsubscribe from receiving published values from the
  Observable.
</li>
<br /><br />

<h4>Operators</h4>
<li>
  Operators allow us to transform the way data is handled, transformed or
  displayed. Operators are pure functions that enable a functional programming
  style of dealing with collections with operations like map, filter, concat,
  reduce, etc.
</li>
