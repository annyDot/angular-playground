<h2>Lesson 5: RxJs and Observables</h2>
<p>
  The essential concepts in RxJS (Reactive Extensions Library for JavaScript)
  which solve async event management are:<br /><br />
</p>

<h4>Observable</h4>
<li>
  a function that converts the ordinary stream of data into an observable stream
  of data. You can think of Observable as a wrapper around the ordinary stream
  of data. Observable stream or simple Observable emits the value from the
  stream asynchronously. It emits the complete signals when the stream completes
  or an error signal if the stream errors out. Observables are declarative. You
  define an observable function just like any other variable. The observable
  starts to emit values only when someone subscribes to it.
</li>
<br /><br />

<h4>Subject</h4>
<li>
  A Subject is a special type of Observable that can act as both observable & an
  observer. It is equivalent to an EventEmitter, and the only way of
  multicasting a value or event to multiple Observers. What does that mean? It
  means that a subject can emit data, on top of having the capability to be
  subscribed to. Subjects implement both subscribe() method and next(), error()
  & complete() methods. Subject can be used in a service to fetch some data, and
  send the result to all components that subscribed to that Subject. Do not
  expose the Subject object directly to components. Instead, return an
  Observable version of it which will make the code much safer and prevent poor
  coding practices.
</li>
<br /><br />

<h4>Observers</h4>
<li>
  The Observable on its own is useless unless someone consumes the value emitted
  by the observable. We call them observers or subscribers. The observers
  communicate with the Observable using callbacks. The observer must subscribe
  with the observable to receive the value from the observable. While
  subscribing it optionally passes the three callbacks. <b>next()</b>,
  <b>error()</b> and <b>complete()</b>. All 3 callbacks are optional!
  <br /><br />The observable starts emitting the value as soon as the observer
  or consumer subscribes to it. The observable invokes the next() callback
  whenever the value arrives in the stream. It passes the value as the argument
  to the next callback. If the error occurs, then the error() callback is
  invoked. It invokes the complete() callback when the stream completes.
</li>
<br /><br />

<h4>Subscriptions</h4>
<li>
  objects that are returned when you subscribe to an Observable. They contain
  many methods such as the unsubscribe() method that you can call to unsubscribe
  from receiving published values from the Observable.
</li>
<br /><br />

<h4>Operators</h4>
<li>
  pure functions that enable a functional programming style of dealing with
  collections with operations like map, filter, concat, reduce, etc.
</li>
